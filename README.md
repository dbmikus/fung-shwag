==========

Fung Shwag is an app for designing floor plans that can easily be shared and modified by others. 

To get it running, run 
	node app.js
in the fung-shwag directory.

Then visit the site by navigating to localhost:3000.

To design you a room, first you draw walls using the draw walls tool towards the top right of the canvas, near the zoom in and zoom out buttons. 

To put furniture into your room, you must click on a piece of furniture you want to add, and then click in the canvas where you want to add it. You can then modify them by clicking the central icon, and then using the tools that appear around the furniture. You can rotate, move, resize, and delete furniture. 

Once you have made a room, save it using the save tool in the top right. Then other people who visit the site will be able to load your room and edit it if they know its name.
