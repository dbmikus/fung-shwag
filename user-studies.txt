Changes based on user feedback:
 
Finer Tools:
                Some users felt the tools were not accurate enough, so we shifted our scale to give the illusion that the user’s had more accurate tools.
 
Button Placement:
                Some users had difficulty finding the tool to draw walls, and immediately started looking around the right side of the screen, closer to the scrollable list of furniture, and sometimes in the scrollable list of furniture. To fix this we moved all of the button closer to the right side of the screen.
Undo Mistakes:
                It is common for a user to make mistakes when placing walls so we made it so that you could click on the last point you placed your wall to delete it.
Feedback when Saving:
                Previously there was no feedback to the user when they saved their room, and some even forgot what they had just named their room which made it virtually impossible to access. Now the browser navigates to the URL, and the refreshing should be an obvious cue that they’ve moved. This would allow them to copy their url, and load it at a later time either directly through their own navigation bar or using the load feature on the app.
